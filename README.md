# Code Samples
A collection of recent code samples from Ashley Powers

## Form-Custom-CSS
At the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, we use FormAssembly to host our user-facing donation form. Previously, the form was accessed via an external FormAssembly-hosted domain. To improve the user experience and maintain domain consistency, we migrated the form to render directly within the globalaffairs.org site. This was implemented using the FormAssembly Drupal module to embed the form on a standard Drupal page. As part of the migration, I updated the embedded form’s markup and styling to conform more closely to our web style guide, using custom CSS as documented in this stylesheet.

## Pattis-Book-Prize
On the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ Drupal website, we utilize the CKEditor module embedded within page templates to enable WYSIWYG-based rich text editing. This source code is from a landing page I developed for a book prize awarded in 2023. This sample includes responsive images at multiple breakpoints, anchor links for in-page navigation, and targeted inline CSS for layout and presentation control.

## Datawrapper-Embed
We regularly publish analyses on the Council’s site based on public opinion research. Because the site does not include a native data visualization tool, we use a third-party platform, Datawrapper, to create interactive charts and I embed them into pages via iframes in the WYSIWYG editor. This source code is an example of one such page. [View the live page](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/2023-2024-survey-public-attitudes-us-intelligence)
