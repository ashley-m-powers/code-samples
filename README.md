# Code Samples
A collection of recent code samples from Ashley Powers

## Form-Custom-CSS
We use FormAssembly to host our user-facing donation form. Previously, the form was accessed via an external FormAssembly-hosted domain. To improve integration and maintain domain consistency, we migrated the form to render directly within the globalaffairs.org site. This was implemented using the FormAssembly Drupal module to embed the form on a standard Drupal page. As part of the migration, I updated the embedded form’s markup and styling to conform more closely to our web style guide, using **custom CSS as documented in this stylesheet**.

## Pattis-Book-Prize
On the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ Drupal website, we utilize the CKEditor module embedded within page templates to enable WYSIWYG-based rich text editing. This **source code is from a landing page** I developed for a book prize awarded in 2023. This sample includes responsive images at multiple breakpoints, anchor links for in-page navigation, and targeted inline CSS for layout and presentation control.

## Datawrapper-Embed
On the Council’s website, we regularly publish analysis based on public opinion research. This **source code** is from one such content page I built. Data visualizations are produced using the third-party platform Datawrapper and embedded into the page via iframes.
