## form-custom-css
We use FormAssembly to host our user-facing donation form. Previously, the form was accessed via an external FormAssembly-hosted domain. To improve integration and maintain domain consistency, we migrated the form to render directly within the globalaffairs.org site. This was implemented using the FormAssembly Drupal module to embed the form on a standard Drupal page. As part of the migration, I updated the embedded form’s markup and styling to conform more closely to our web style guide, using custom CSS as documented in this stylesheet.
